## Introduction

The **Forecast App** is a comprehensive tool designed to guide users through the entire forecasting workflow, from raw data to scenario analysis. It is tailored for both beginners and experienced practitioners, allowing the exploration, modeling, and explanation of time series data without requiring advanced knowledge of forecasting techniques.  

The app is organized into four main sections —**Data**, **Analyze**, **Features**, and **Forecast**— which collectively enable users to:  

- Upload and explore time series data  
- Detect and handle missing values and anomalies  
- Transform and preprocess data for improved forecasting performance  
- Create and select relevant features, both internal and external  
- Fit and optimize a wide range of forecasting models, including classical, machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble approaches  
- Evaluate, compare, and explain the models’ predictions  
- Generate probabilistic forecasts and business-oriented scenarios  

All actions performed in the app are **automatically saved**, meaning that any transformation, cleaning, or feature engineering applied to the series is carried forward to the subsequent steps. This ensures a consistent and reproducible workflow from raw data to final forecasts.  

The app also provides great flexibility in analysis: interactive visualizations, configurable model parameters, and multiple options for evaluation and explanation allow users to tailor the process to their specific needs. Common controls, such as the **gear button** ⚙️, enable the selection of specific parameters. The **play button** ▶️ is used to execute actions like generating forecasts or running tests, while a **reset button** 🔄 is available to clear all settings and start fresh. Moreover, 
for most tables displayed throughout the dashboard, an **Export** button is available, allowing users to download the table contents in **CSV** or **Excel** format for further use.  

Follow this user guide to leverage the full potential of the Forecast App to obtain accurate forecasts, understand model behavior, and explore different scenarios for informed decision-making.

## Section 1: Data

The **Data** section is the starting point of the Forecasting App. Here you can choose which time series to analyze and prepare for forecasting.  

#### Predefined datasets
The app includes a few **predefined univariate time series datasets** that you can load instantly. These datasets are useful for exploring the app’s functionalities and testing the workflow without needing to upload your own data.  

#### Import your own data
You can also import your own **univariate time series dataset** in CSV format (sep = "," and dec = ".").  
The file must contain the following columns:  

- **`date`**: the timestamp of the observation (must be in a valid date format, e.g., `YYYY-MM-DD`)  
- **`id`**: an identifier for the time series (can be set to a default value if only one series is provided)  
- **`value`**: the observed numerical value  

The following frequencies are supported:  

- `year` (1 observation per year)  
- `semester` (2 observations per year)  
- `quarter` (4 observations per year)  
- `month` (12 observations per year)  
- `week` (52 observations per year)  
- `bus-day` (252 observations per year, business days)  
- `day` (365 observations per year, calendar days)  
- `hour` (365 × 24 observations per year, calendar hours)  
- `half-hour` (365 × 48 observations per year, calendar half-hours)  

#### Options available
Once a dataset is loaded, you have to set some important global parameters that will be used throughout the app:  

- **Frequency**: set the frequency of the time series (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).  
- **Forecast Horizon**: specify how many future periods to forecast.  
- **Assessment Period**: define the historical period to be used for model assessment.  
- **Impute missing values**: apply automatic interpolation based on the declared frequency to handle missing observations without the need of manual imputation.

#### Explore the data
You can briefly explore the dataset:  

- **Table**: view the raw data in tabular format  
- **Structure**: check the internal structure of the dataset (variable types, number of rows, etc.)  
- **Summary statistics**: obtain basic descriptive statistics of the time series (mean, median, min, max, missing values, etc.)  

This initial exploration helps you quickly assess whether the data has been uploaded correctly and is ready for further analysis.  

> ⚠️ **Note**: Make sure your dataset is properly formatted, as incorrect column names or 
> unsupported frequency values will prevent the app from processing the data.  

> ⚠️ **Note**: The uploaded data is now **fully editable**.  
> Users can directly modify values within the data table (e.g., correcting errors, adjusting entries).  
> Any edits are automatically saved and will affect all subsequent steps of the workflow.  



## Section 2: Analyze

The **Analyze** section provides a set of tools to better understand and prepare your time series before building forecasting models.  

From the main navigation bar, you can click on **Analyze** and then select one of the available options from the dropdown menu. Each option corresponds to a specific step in the analysis workflow.  

In this section you can:  

- **Visualize** the time series with interactive plots to better understand trends, seasonality, and irregular patterns.  
- Perform **Hypothesis Testing** to check for important statistical properties such as stationarity or autocorrelation.  
- Detect and correct **Anomalies** in the data (e.g., outliers or unusual spikes).  
- Apply **Transformations** to stabilize variance, remove seasonality, or make the series more suitable for modeling.  

These tools are designed to help you diagnose potential issues in the data and apply the necessary preprocessing steps before moving on to feature creation and forecasting.  


### Visualize

The **Visualize** subsection allows you to explore the main characteristics of your time series through a set of interactive plots.  

#### Panels displayed
Four plots are displayed:  

1. **Time series plot** shows the raw time series (with optional smoothing and imputation).  
2. **Autocorrelation plot (ACF)**: displays correlations between the series and its lagged values.  
3. **Decomposition plot**: breaks down the series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.  
4. **Seasonality plot**: visualizes recurring seasonal patterns within the chosen frequency.  

This visualization step helps you gain an initial understanding of the structure, seasonality, and quality of your time series before applying more advanced analysis or forecasting techniques. 


### Hypothesis Testing

The **Hypothesis Testing** subsection allows you to check key statistical properties of your time series. This step is important to understand whether the data satisfies common assumptions required by forecasting models.  

#### Tests performed
The app groups the statistical tests into three categories:  

- **Normality tests**: 
  - *Jarque-Bera test* 
  - *Shapiro-Wilk test*  
 
- **Autocorrelation tests**:  
  - *Box-Pierce test*  
  - *Ljung-Box test*  

- **Stationarity tests**:  
  - *Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test*  
  - *Phillips-Perron (PP) test*  
  - *Kwiatkowski-Phillips-Schmidt-Shin (KPSS) test*  

#### Options available
Before running the tests, you can choose whether to apply a transformation to the series using a dropdown menu. The available transformations are:  

- *Multiply by -1*  
- *Add 1*  
- *Log*  
- *Box-Cox*  
- *Log-Interval*  
- *Min-Max* scaling  
- *Standardization*  
- *Differencing*  
- *Seasonal Differencing*  

This feature allows you to test hypotheses not only on the original series but also on transformed versions, which can be useful to verify whether a transformation improves normality, reduces autocorrelation, or induces stationarity.  

#### Panels displayed
The subsection is organized into four panels:  

1. **Test results table**: displays the outcome of all hypothesis tests (test statistic, p-value, and decision).  
2. **Distribution plot**: shows the distribution of the time series values compared with a normal curve.  
3. **Time series plot**: visualizes the raw (or transformed) series to support interpretation of the tests.  
4. **Autocorrelation plot (ACF)**: highlights the presence of autocorrelation in the series.

This subsection helps you assess whether the series is normally distributed, autocorrelated, or stationary — information that is crucial when deciding which forecasting models and preprocessing steps are most appropriate.  


### Anomaly Detection

The **Anomaly Detection** subsection allows you to identify and optionally clean unusual observations in your time series. Detecting anomalies is important because extreme values can distort model estimation and forecasts.  

#### Options available
You can adjust several parameters when detecting anomalies:  

- **Anomaly method**: choose the detection method (*currently only STL is available*).  
- **Significance level**: set the statistical threshold for identifying anomalies.  
- **Maximum % of anomalies**: limit the proportion of points flagged as anomalies.  
- **Cleaning level**: define the quantile threshold used for the cleaning step.   

#### Panels displayed
Two plots are generated to visualize the results:  

1. **Time series with anomalies**: shows the original series with anomalies highlighted.  
2. **Cleaned time series**: displays the series after anomalies have been removed.  
3. **Anomaly data**: lists the detected anomalies with their timestamps, values, and other characteristics.

This subsection ensures that subsequent analyses and forecasts are performed on a series that reflects the typical behavior of the data, minimizing the impact of extreme or erroneous observations.  


### Transform

The **Transform** subsection allows you to apply transformations to your time series to improve its statistical properties and suitability for forecasting models. Transformations can stabilize variance, reduce skewness, or remove trends and seasonality.  

#### Options available
You can adjust the following parameters:  

- **Transformation dropdown**: choose a transformation to apply to the series. Available transformations include:  
  - *Multiply by -1*  
  - *Add 1*  
  - *Log*  
  - *Box-Cox*  
  - *Log-Interval*  
  - *Min-Max scaling*  
  - *Standardization*  
  - *Differencing*  
  - *Seasonal Differencing*  
- **Time period**: select the start and end of the series to transform.  

#### Panels displayed
Four plots are generated to help you assess the effects of transformations:  

1. **Time series**: shows the transformed series.  
2. **Autocorrelation (ACF) plot**: displays autocorrelations after transformation.  
3. **Decomposition plot**: visualizes trend, seasonality, and remainder components.  
4. **Seasonality plot**: highlights the seasonal patterns in the transformed series.  

Using this subsection, you can preprocess your series for modeling, ensuring that it meets the assumptions required by different forecasting methods.  



## Section 3: Features

4. **Time series plot with features**: displays the original series together with all added features for visual inspection.  
5. **Correlation**: shows the correlation between the time series and internal features.  

> ⚠️ **Note:** Lag orders must be greater or equal than the forecast horizon in order to be used in forecasting.   

> ⚠️ **Note:** Lag Rolling Periods must be greater or equal than two and are computed only on the maximum lag order.   


### External Features

The **External Features** subsection allows you to include features from external datasets that may influence your time series. These features help improve forecast accuracy by incorporating additional information.  

#### Options available
- **Upload external dataset**: the dataset must follow the same structure as in Section 1, with columns `date`, `id`, and two or more feature columns.  

#### Panels displayed
