# Forecast App

The **Forecast App** is a comprehensive tool designed to guide users 
through the entire forecasting workflow, from raw data to scenario analysis.
It is tailored for both beginners and experienced practitioners, allowing the 
exploration, modeling, and explanation of time series data without requiring 
advanced knowledge of forecasting techniques.  

The app is organized into four main sections —**Data**, **Analyze**, 
**Features**, and **Forecast**— which collectively enable users to:  

- Upload and explore time series data  
- Detect and handle missing values and anomalies  
- Transform and preprocess data for improved forecasting performance  
- Create and select relevant features, both internal and external  
- Fit and optimize a wide range of forecasting models, including classical, 
machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble approaches  
- Evaluate, compare, and explain the models’ predictions  
- Generate probabilistic forecasts and business-oriented scenarios  

The app provides great flexibility in analysis: interactive visualizations, 
configurable model parameters, and multiple options for evaluation and 
explanation allow users to tailor the process to their specific needs.
